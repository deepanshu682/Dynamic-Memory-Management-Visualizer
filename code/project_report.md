### 2.3 Algorithm Implementation Module
This module contains the implementation of various memory management algorithms, each with its unique characteristics and use cases.

#### Memory Allocation Algorithms:

1. First-Fit Algorithm
   - Description: The First-Fit algorithm searches through the memory blocks sequentially and allocates the first block that is large enough to satisfy the request.
   - Working Process:
     * Starts from the beginning of memory
     * Scans through each block until finding a suitable free block
     * Splits the block if it's larger than needed
     * Allocates the requested portion
   - Advantages: 
     * Fast allocation process
     * Simple implementation
     * Quick response time
   - Disadvantages:
     * Can lead to external fragmentation
     * May not utilize memory optimally
     * Can create small unusable fragments

2. Best-Fit Algorithm
   - Description: The Best-Fit algorithm searches for the smallest free block that is large enough to satisfy the request.
   - Working Process:
     * Scans entire memory to find smallest suitable block
     * Compares all available blocks
     * Selects the block with minimum waste
     * Splits block if necessary
   - Advantages:
     * Minimizes wasted space
     * Better memory utilization
     * Reduces internal fragmentation
   - Disadvantages:
     * Slower allocation process
     * Creates small unusable fragments
     * Requires scanning entire memory

3. Worst-Fit Algorithm
   - Description: The Worst-Fit algorithm allocates the largest available free block to a request.
   - Working Process:
     * Scans memory for largest free block
     * Compares all available blocks
     * Selects the largest suitable block
     * Splits remaining space
   - Advantages:
     * Leaves larger free blocks
     * Better for future allocations
     * Reduces external fragmentation
   - Disadvantages:
     * Can waste more memory
     * Slower allocation process
     * May not be efficient for small requests

4. Next-Fit Algorithm
   - Description: The Next-Fit algorithm is a modified version of First-Fit that starts searching from the last allocated position.
   - Working Process:
     * Maintains pointer to last allocation
     * Starts search from that position
     * Wraps around to beginning if needed
     * Continues until finding suitable block
   - Advantages:
     * Faster than First-Fit for repeated allocations
     * More uniform distribution
     * Better for sequential allocations
   - Disadvantages:
     * Can lead to uneven distribution
     * May miss suitable blocks
     * Can create fragmentation

#### Page Replacement Algorithms:

1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
   - Description: The FIFO algorithm replaces the page that has been in memory the longest.
   - Working Process:
     * Maintains queue of pages
     * New pages added to end of queue
     * Oldest page removed when needed
     * Simple circular buffer implementation
   - Advantages:
     * Simple implementation
     * Easy to understand
     * Low overhead
   - Disadvantages:
     * May replace frequently used pages
     * Doesn't consider page usage
     * Can lead to high page fault rate

2. Least Recently Used (LRU)
   - Description: The LRU algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period.
   - Working Process:
     * Tracks last access time of each page
     * Maintains access history
     * Replaces least recently accessed page
     * Updates access times on each use
   - Advantages:
     * Better performance than FIFO
     * Considers page usage patterns
     * More efficient memory usage
   - Disadvantages:
     * More complex implementation
     * Higher overhead
     * Requires additional data structures
